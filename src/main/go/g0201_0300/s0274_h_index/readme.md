## 274\. H-Index

Medium

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> paper, return compute the researcher's `h`**\-index**.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**\-index**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = [3,0,6,1,5]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** citations = [1,3,1]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

```golang
func hIndex(citations []int) int {
	len := len(citations)
	freqArray := make([]int, len+1)
	for _, citation := range citations {
		if citation > len {
			freqArray[len]++
		} else {
			freqArray[citation]++
		}
	}
	totalSoFar := 0
	for k := len; k >= 0; k-- {
		totalSoFar += freqArray[k]
		if totalSoFar >= k {
			return k
		}
	}
	return -1
}
```
